## Project Overview

This project is a simple task manager built using Flask (Python) and a basic frontend.  It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks.  It's intended as a learning project and a starting point for more complex task management applications.

## Features

*   **Task Creation:**  Users can create new tasks with titles and descriptions.
*   **Task Listing:**  View a list of all tasks.
*   **Task Details:**  View details of a specific task.
*   **Task Updating:**  Edit existing task details.
*   **Task Deletion:**  Remove tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd simple-task-manager
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ls -l
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Set up environment variables (if needed, check `config.py` or similar):
    ```bash
    # Example for setting a Flask secret key (if required)
    export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
    ```
2.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in the terminal output).

## Usage

[Describe how to use the application.  Include screenshots if helpful (you'd need to host images somewhere and link to them, or include them in your `static` folder and link using relative paths or `url_for`).]
