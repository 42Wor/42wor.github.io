Surjith here from Web3Forms.

I saw you've recently tried Web3Forms for Contact Form. Did you setup correctly and received your first email?

Can you reply? Even if you have not set it up yet, just let me know. Even a thumbs-up üëç emoji will also help. But please do reply to me!

If it's not working for you, make sure you check our [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.web3forms.com/getting-started/troubleshooting).

**Quick question:** Why did you decide to use Web3Forms? How did you find us? Do you have any dislikes so far?

Thanks so much for your time!
